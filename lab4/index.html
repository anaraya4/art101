	<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>We learned how to come up with instructions on how to create a game in js. We also learned how to organize the instructions of a game in a form that js could understand.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>At first, we struggled coming up with ideas on what game we wanted to do and we also struggled on some of the instructions and how to translate it into pseudocode. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Below is our pseudocode for a connext 4 game ,

	<pre><code>
		//Print the board befpre each turn
		  //Loop through each ro
		    //Loop through each space
		      //Prnt either Blue or red O, or space
		      //Print || in between
		    //Print newline at the end of each row
		  //see if anyone has 4 in a row, either horizontally, verticall or diagonally
		  //if user has 4 in a row, print "You Win"
		  //if computer has 4 in a row, print "You lose"
		  //If all the tiles are filled and no one has 4 in a row, print "Draw"
	</pre></code>
